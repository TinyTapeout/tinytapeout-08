  # Bidirectional pins
  uio[0]: "Crispy input bit 0 that toggles the noise on the hsync signal on or off. Also adds one bit of noise to audio."
  uio[1]: "Crispy input bit 1 toggles the noise on the B signal on or off. Also adds one bit of noise to audio."
  uio[2]: "Crispy input bit 2 toggles the noise on the G signal on or off. Also adds one bit of noise to audio."
  uio[3]: "Crispy input bit 3 toggles the noise on the R signal on or off. Also adds one bit of noise to audio."
  uio[4]: "Crispy input bit 4 that toggles the noise on the vsync signal on or off. Also adds one bit of noise to audio."
  uio[5]: "Crispy input bit 5 that sets the noise level applied to the R, G, and B wires to high or low. Also adds one bit of noise to audio."
  uio[6]: "Audio input bit"
  uio[7]: "Audio output bit"
