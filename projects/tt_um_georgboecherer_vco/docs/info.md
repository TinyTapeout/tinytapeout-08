## How it works

A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) using 4 differential stages and a bias controller. At each stage, the outputs are low-pass filtered by nfet transistors connected as capacitors to ground. 

The first analog pin `ua[0]` can be used as input to control the frequency by changing the gate voltages of nfet current sources connected to ground. The second analog pin `ua[1]` can be used to monitor the gate voltage generated by the bias controller of the pfet current sources connected to VDD. Alternatively, the second analog pin `ua[1]` can be used as input pin to overwrite the bias controller.

The 4 differential stages provide in total 8 tap signals with phase differences of 360/8. The 8 tap signals are converted to digital signals by buffers and output at the 8 digital output pins `uo[0]` to `uo[7]`. *NB:* the 8 tap signals are ordered by wiring convenience, not by phase.

## How to test

Connect a control voltage or current to the analog input pin `ua[0]` and observe the oscillating signals at the digital output pins.

## External hardware

DC power supply for the control voltage/current, oscilloscope for monitoring the outputs.
