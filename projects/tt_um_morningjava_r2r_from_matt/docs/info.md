## How it works

Please refer to Matt Venn's R2R DAC description, as this is a clone of that project.

## How to test

Set the `external data` input high to provide the DAC with external data.

Then drive the 8 inputs and observe the analog output.

## External hardware

A multimeter to measure the output voltage on analog pin 0.
